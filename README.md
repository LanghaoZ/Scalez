## Scalez

Scalz is a scalable system designed to handle large sudden burst of QPS and high concurrency in general. It can be applied to a range of services, and Scalz implemented the eBay like bidding system.

Scalz is developed as my Capstone project for UCLA's Master's degree in Computer Science.
